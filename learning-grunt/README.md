Grunt
=====
This is my first attempt at learning Grunt. The first three versions of this folder are just trying to run through the whole process from start to finish. 

Folder 'v4' is the first good working version I have made. It compiles sass files, watches files, and livereloads the page as it should.

Folder 'v5' is intended to look at everything in the project folder, not just the 'assets' folder. That way file saves on .html and includes will do a page refresh as well.

It's not much, but it's a start.
