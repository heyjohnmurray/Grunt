# RV Grunt Spin Up

This is what the RV spin up folder looks like with Grunt.js. We're conidering moving to Grunt to keep up with the way the front end dev community is moving. More and more big companies are using some sort of Javascript-based task runner to streamline their code and save development time. It makes sense for Red Ventures' front end devs to have at least a working knowledge of this technology in order to stay on the cutting edge and to utilize within their workflow whenever possible.

### Before We Start

Grunt runs off of the Node.js platform. So before we get install Grunt, we need to make sure we have Node installed. It should be as simple as going to the [node.js site](nodejs.org/download/) and download the Mac Installer.

Remember that sometimes when you install new software onto a Mac you need to add 'sudo' to some of your terminal installation commands. If you have any issues, feel free to grab one of the code leads and they should be able to walk you through it. Joseph Lombardo in IT is also a good person to talk to if you have issues with installing Node.

## Installation

Now that we have Node installed, we'll be able to do everything else through the command line using Node's package manager (NPM). We'll download Grunt and any plugin we use in Grunt through the NPM.
